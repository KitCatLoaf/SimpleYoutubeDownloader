# SimpleYoutubeDownloader
A very simple, lightweight, easy to use YouTube downloader that runs in your terminal and now works through GUI!

# DETAILS (READ)

When you download a video the program will make a new file called "Downloaded_Files" in the root directory of main.py

Put the code in a folder for additional organization if wanted.

If you run in a terminal, additional output will be in the same terminal. Running without terminal will open a new terminal window for you. App also outputs status with a label on the bottom of the page.
